My code for the Algolia full-stack application challenge.

## How to Run It

Clone this repository. 

Run `npm install` in the root directory to install the dependencies. 

Export an `APP_ID`, `SERVER_API_KEY` and `APP_API_KEY` in your env. This will then be used when you run the application.

Go into the `app/` directory and run `npm run build` to build a minified and optimised version of the app to serve.

Go back to the root directory, and run the command `node server/app.js` and you should get the response `App is now listening on port 9000!`.
